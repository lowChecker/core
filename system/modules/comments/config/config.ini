; Here you can define how classes and templates are loaded.
;
; Options:
;
;   [Mapper, PSR-0]
;
; Mapper class loader:
;
;   The mapper class loader uses a mapper array to map class names to file
;   paths. The mapper array is built by parsing the config/autoload.php files,
;   which can be autogenerated with the autoload generator (developer tools).
;
;   The mapper class loader gives you flexibility in structuring your extension
;   files and also allows you to override core classes. You can even make your
;   own classes overridable for others.
;
; PSR-0 class loader:
;
;   The PSR-0 class loader finds class files by converting the namespace of a
;   class into a file path. E.g. the class "\Avisota\Mail\Transport" is mapped
;   to the file "system/modules/Avisota/Mail/Transport.php".
;
;   The PSR-0 class loader requires that you stick to the naming conventions.
